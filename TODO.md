I think I'll do this in a few stages.

this first stage, just clean up code but not try to do the decoupling, which is a big change in mindset.

so, clean up code, then I can get back to working on animation stuff and text stuff.

next stage is important though, where I am actually creating a model that lives in one place in the game, sort of like a redux store.

at that point I can maybe move a player function to the gameview?
and can for instance render individual cells without the reference to containers at all????
