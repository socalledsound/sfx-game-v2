# sfx-game-2

the code refactor of this sfx game ended up being pretty major so I decided to just push a new repo.

trying to embrace declarative concepts/ convert this from a more OO style game into something that can work in React Native.  

will likely do one more rewrite with more seperation that stores state for each object in a central repo rather than on the individual objects?

but need some guidance on that from someone with more experience.
